I'm trying to build a react app and when I start the website, I get this error message:


Compiled with problems:

ERROR in ./src/components/Sidebar/index.js 56:39-51

export 'SideBarRoute' (imported as 'SideBarRoute') was not found in './SidebarElements' (possible exports: CloseIcon, Icon, SideBtnWrap, SidebarContainer, SidebarLink, SidebarMenu, SidebarRoute, SidebarWrapper)

I'm stuck on it
